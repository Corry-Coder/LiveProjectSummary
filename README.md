# Live Project

## Introduction

During my last two weeks at The Tech Academy, I worked with a team of developers to create a MVC website application for a real client. It was a great opportunity to get a feel for what the day-to-day operations of a software developer is really like. I've learned a lot and gained some invaluable experience along the way. I had the opportunity to fix bugs, clean up code, and add features. It's a great feeling knowing that I contributed to an actual dev team and the code I've created will be used in a website for a real client. Not only did I learn about Aglie and Scrum methodologies and teamwork, I also learned a lot about myself along the way such as my strengths and weaknesses. During my time on the Live Project, I've come to realized that HTML and CSS weren't really my strong points. It was good to know that because it gave me the opportunity to address those issues by picking front end stories to challenge myself to improve. By the end of the two week sprint, I got a lot better on the front end, which I believe will go a long way in my programming career.

Below are some examples and descriptions of the stories that I worked on with screenshots.

## Back End Stories

* Image Display Story

## Image Display Story

For this story, the slideshow on the home page would not display unless the user is logged in as an "Admin". I was tasked with fixing this issue so that anyone would have access to the slideshow on the homepage. To fix this issue I had to figure out how to allow everyone access to to the slideshow images on the homepage while still allowing access to the CRUD methods to the "Admin". After researching the issue, I found that you can use the tag "[Allow Anonymous]" tag to allow access to certain methods while keeping the Admin role still at the top of the class.

## Front End Stories

* CSS Jitter Story
* Subscriber Edit Story

## CSS Jitter Story

For this story, on the register page, the input fields for the form would move when you hover your mouse over them making the page look unprofessional. My job was to fix this issue. To fix the issue, I used CSS to change the border size of the input fields.

## Subscriber Edit Story

For this story, the edit page of the Subscriber section was not very responsive and appealing. My task was to make thepage responsive to users of all screen sizes. I also had to use styling to make the page look aesthetically pleasing. The following screenshots show my progress during  this task.
