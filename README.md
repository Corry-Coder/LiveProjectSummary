# Live Project

## Introduction

During my last two weeks at The Tech Academy, I worked with a team of developers to create a MVC website application for a real client. It was a great opportunity to get a feel for what the day-to-day operations of a software developer is really like. I've learned a lot and gained some invaluable experience along the way. I had the opportunity to fix bugs, clean up code, and add features. It's a great feeling knowing that I contributed to an actual dev team and the code I've created will be used in a website for a real client. Not only did I learn about Aglie and Scrum methodologies and teamwork, I also learned a lot about myself along the way such as my strengths and weaknesses. During my time on the Live Project, I've come to realized that HTML and CSS weren't really my strong points. It was good to know that because it gave me the opportunity to address those issues by picking front end stories to challenge myself to improve. By the end of the two week sprint, I got a lot better on the front end, which I believe will go a long way in my programming career.

Below are some examples and descriptions of the stories that I worked on with screenshots.

For this story, the slideshow on the home page would not display unless the user is logged in as an "Admin". I was tasked with fixing this issue so that anyone would have access to the slideshow on the homepage.
